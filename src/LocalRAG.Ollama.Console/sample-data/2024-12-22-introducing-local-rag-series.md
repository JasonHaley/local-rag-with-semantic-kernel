# Announcing: The Local RAG Series with Semantic Kernel

This year I've spent a lot of time focusing on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its related technologies. I've also had my eye on agents and plan to focus on them a lot in 2025. From what I've seen with my limited work with agents so far is: **they can be chatty**. This has lead me to believe that agents will **really** take off once either the price of LLMs available via APIs lower (a lot) or local models become sufficient to use.

Since I don't know enough about what you can do with local models - I figured this is a great time to start digging into them. Plus, why not learn them with RAG and Semantic Kernel - two things I've spent a lot of time with this year. That should give me a good staring point to dig into agents early 2025.

Over the past year I have played with a few local models using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) but I haven't created any projects using them yet. This blog series will chronicle my exploration into using local models to implement RAG applications using C# and the good and bad I find along the way ... stay tuned!

Are you using local models for your RAG? If so, I'd love to hear more about it on twitter/X.
