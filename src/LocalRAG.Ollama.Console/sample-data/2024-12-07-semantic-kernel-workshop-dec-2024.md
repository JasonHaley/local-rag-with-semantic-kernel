Yesterday Bill Wilder, Juan Pablo Garcia Gonzalez and I put on a [Hands-on AI Workshop in Burlington  MA](https://www.meetup.com/north-boston-azure-cloud-user-group/events/304611894/?eventOrigin=group_past_events). The goal was to give the attendees hands on experience using Semantic Kernel. The target audience was .NET developers using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio looking to learn GenAI. 

I gave the middle presentations and labs focusing on RAG. 

# Talk: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

![Slide 1](/img/2024-12-07_img1.jpg)

This was an intro level presentation on what RAG is and the concepts you need to know to create a RAG system. The presentation can be downloaded on the github [here](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/assets/Workshop-RAGIntro.pdf)

The labs that were RAG related where:

* [Lab 3: Using WebRetrieverPlugin to create a RAG application](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab3/readme.md) - [(Visual Studio edition)](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab3/readme-vs.md)
* [Lab 4: Creating a RAG application to Search a PDF](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab4/readme.md) - [(Visual Studio Edition)](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab4/readme-vs.md)
* [Lab 5: Putting it all together](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab5/readme.md) - [(Visual Studio edition)](https://github.com/bostonazure/rag-vector-agent-semantic-kernel/blob/main/labs/lab5/readme-vs.md)

We are planning more workshops early next year, so if you are interested please reach out to me on twitter @haleyjason (or email - info@jasonhaley.com) and let me know if you are interested in future workshops on AI with .NET.

If you have a comment, please message me @haleyjason on twitter/X.
