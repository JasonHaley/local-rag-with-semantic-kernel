Yesterday was [Boston Code Camp 36](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC36/info) hard to believe it has been going on for 20+ years now. For me it is one of those regular events for the Boston tech community that is well worth spending a Saturday attending.

It was nice to see a lot of regular faces and meet some new people.

# Talk: Getting Started with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

![RAG Slide 1](/img/2024-03-24img1.jpg)

I was surprise the room was full, it was good to see so many developers, students and architects - mostly with .NET backgrounds looking to get started with RAG applications.

The presentation pdf can be downloaded [here](https://jhaleyfiles2016.blob.core.windows.net/public/GettingStartedWithRAG.pdf). I am already making changes to it for the next time. I had some good questions and also noticed there are some concepts that are more confusing and need explained better.

# Talk: Azure OpenAI Patterns for Software Engineers

![Patterns Slide 1](/img/2024-03-24img2.jpg)

This was my first time co-presenting with Juan Pablo Garcia Gonzalez. We had some good questions and an engaged audience (which always makes it more fun).

I mentioned a demo where the workflow has the LLM generate SQL - that is this demo: [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/openai/tree/main/End_to_end_Solutions/AOAISearchDemo). It is on my list to review. The file that has does the majority of the SQL generation prompting is [chatstructured.py](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/openai/blob/main/End_to_end_Solutions/AOAISearchDemo/app/backend/approaches/chatstructured.py).
