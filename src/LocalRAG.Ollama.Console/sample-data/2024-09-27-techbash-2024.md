This week I presented at the [TechBash conference](https://techbash.com/) in Pocono Manor, PA. All the resources for the conference are available on the [TechBash GitHub repo](https://github.com/TechBash/techbash2024). Below are links to my presentations specifically.

It was great to see companies sending their employees to conferences again. This was my first time at TechBash, and I finally got to meet Alvin Ashcraft in person (the [Morning Dew](https://www.alvinashcraft.com/)). I also met a bunch of people from the Philly area and around Pennsylvania, but there were attendees from all over-even a couple of guys from Panama!
