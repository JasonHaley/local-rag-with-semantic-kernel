Today at lunchtime [Bill Wilder](https://blog.codingoutloud.com/) and I spoke at the [Virtual Boston Azure meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazure/events/304405840/). Our talks were based on the same material we presented on [Tuesday night](/2024/11/12/november-2024-virtual-boston-azure-meetup/), however I introduced [eShopSupport](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport) as well today.

The recording of the session can be found on the [(Lunchtime editions) Boston Azure YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/FYWJU7LBi8k).
