# Announcing: The eShopSupport Series

In case you missed this week's [.NET Conf Focus on AI](https://focus.dotnetconf.net/) you can find all the videos on the [dotnet YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnet). The one I want to point out here is: [Better Together: .NET Aspire and Semantic Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9bTeaaAlQ) with Steve Sanderson and Matthew Bolanos. 

Steve's portion of the talk is a distilled version of his NDC talk earlier this year: [How to add genuinely useful AI to your webapp (not just chatbots)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSNAvFJoP4M) where he introduced the [eShopSupport](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport) project. ***If you are a .NET developer looking for ways to use AI in real world applications - you should absolutely watch that video.***

Starting next week, I will be digging into the eShopSupport codebase and blogging about it. Since it isn't a RAG application - I don't think it fits into the [RAG Demo Series](/tags/rag-demo-series/) so I am going to be creating a new blog series focusing on this one [codebase](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport).

I have been waiting for the eShopSupport repo to be made public ever since I watched Steve's NDC talk so I am really looking forward to this! Stay tuned.
