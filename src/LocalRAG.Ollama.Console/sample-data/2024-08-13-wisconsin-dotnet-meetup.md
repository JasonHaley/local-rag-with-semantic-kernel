Last Thursday night I spoke at the [Wisconsin .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/wisconsin-net-users-group/events/301852505/) near Milwaukee, WI. I was nice to meet so many .NET developers interested in RAG and AI.

To carry on the tradition from my Memphis talk, I gave the presentation a local look using images related to Milwaukee generated from Bing/create.

# Talk: Getting Started with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

One of my demos failed to deploy before the talk, but I don't think it was missed due to having so many good questions. It was really nice meeting a user group with so many core members. Plus the pizza was really good!

Also, I mentioned it to someone at that talk - keep an eye out for this repo to show up: [https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport) and here is the talk by Steven Sanderson that introduces that code from NDC: [How to add genuinely useful AI to your webapp (not just chatbots) - Steve Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSNAvFJoP4M)
