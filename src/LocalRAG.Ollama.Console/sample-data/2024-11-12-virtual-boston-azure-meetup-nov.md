Last night [Bill Wilder](https://blog.codingoutloud.com/) and I spoke at the [Virtual Boston Azure meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazure/events/304405840/). Our talks were about adding GenAI to .NET applications. My portion was mostly demos that focused on Azure SQL's new native VECTOR support, Entity Framework Core and Semantic Kernel.

The recording of the session can be found on the [Boston Azure YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiBtBEGnnBc).
