Last Thursday night I spoke at the [Memphis Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/300585623/), it was nice to meet some people in person and see how excited others are about finding valuable ways to work GenAI into their applications.

I also gave my slide deck a completely new look (Memphis themed via Bing/create):

# Talk: Getting Started with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Since the presentation was hybrid, there were not as many questions as the other two times I've given the talk ... or that is my guess at the reason why it was so quiet. That also means I should have put that third demo back in the presentation (I took a demo out after the first version of the talk since there were so many questions and needed to free up time for Q&A). Next time I'll have it ready to use in case I need it.
