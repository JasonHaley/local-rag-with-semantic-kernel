Last night I spoke at the [Virtual Boston Azure meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazure/events/302852509/). The talk was about the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) and geared towards developers.

The recording of the session can be found on the [Boston Azure YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ovdG3J2Tc).
