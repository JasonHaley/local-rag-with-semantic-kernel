Yesterday was [Boston Code Camp 37](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC37/info). I spent the majority of the day talking with people in the community I haven't seen for awhile, as well as some new people I hadn't met before. I only made it to one session (Juan Pablo Garcia Gonzalez - Agentic AI: Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent Systems), which was good and got me thinking about how to rewrite my demos in my talk to use agents.

It was nice to see a good amount of new (and younger) people attending the code camp. We always have a lot of student volunteers from Curry College that help out and the last couple of years I've noticed some of them still continue to attend even after they have graduated.

After having a full day of socializing, I realized that I must be an introvert because my energy was gone.

# Talk: Using Structured Data in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Applications

![Slide 1](/img/2024-11-24_img1.jpg)

This was the first time presenting this talk. I spent the majority of last week getting the demos working, then built the presentation from that. The idea was to show Baseline RAG, then explore where it starts to not work, then move on to ways to retrieve data in order to answer some questions that Baseline RAG just can't do.

The demos list:

* Baseline RAG
* Limitations of Baseline RAG
* RAG with a Relational Database
* Text-to-SQL
* RAG with a Graph Database
* Cypher-to-SQL

The demos all went well, though do to the amount of questions I didn't have a chance to show the code details.

I was surprised by the number of questions. There were some really good RAG related questions - very nice to see.

Here is the resource slide:
