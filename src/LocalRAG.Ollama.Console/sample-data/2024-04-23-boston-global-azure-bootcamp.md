This past weekend was [Boston Azure's Edition of the annual Global Azure Bootcamp](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazure/events/300138716/). This year we focused on AI and hands-on-labs.

The odd thing about when we scheduled the meetup was we had a lot of people sign up for the group just to rsvp - before most of the existing members had gotten around to rsvp'ing. We did not expect that. It is a mystery as how they heard about the event so quick. We only had one room reserved, so there really was a hard cap on how many people we could let in.

There were a couple of challenges to start the day off with: getting into the room (not uncommon with Saturday events) and finding an availble room with tables and outlets (necessary for hands-on-labs). However, once we got those resolved it was pretty smooth sailing from there.

It did end up being a full house ... with a few extra tables added to get everyone in.

My session was the third of the day - right after lunch.

# Talk: Getting Started with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

I presented [Getting Started with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://jhaleysftp.blob.core.windows.net/files/GettingStartedWithRAG.pdf) but was able to skip some of the simple stuff due to earlier sessions covering it (like Chat GPT, etc.). Like with Boston Code Camp, there were a lot of questions and the audience was engaged with the topic.

# Lab: Using LangChain to Build a RAG Application With Boston Azure's Youtube Transcripts

Once I got to the lab, [Using LangChain to Build a RAG Application With Boston Azure's Youtube Transcripts](https://github.com/JasonHaley/youtube-transcript-rag/tree/main/python) time flew by. Most attendees didn't have time to get through all of them.

The lab is on my GitHub repo [youtube-transcript-rag](https://github.com/JasonHaley/youtube-transcript-rag/tree/main/python)

It was great to see some faces I hadn't seen in awhile and nice to meet a bunch of new people.
